In our first assignment of the core module "Developing as a Manager and Leader" we have to reply to the statement, "leaders are born not made".
The fundamental differences between leadership and management are not well defined according to James Kotterman [[@Kottermann-2006aa]](title).


# Leadership vs. Management

Bernhard M. Bass quoted in 1985, "The process of influencing the activities of an organized group in its efforts toward goal-setting and goal achievement‚Äù [[@Bass1985]](title), Northouse agrees with the statement [[@Northouse2021]](title).  

The role of the management is to control a group or a group of individuals to achieve a goal.
Jocko Willink wrote that without a team - group of individuals - there can be no leadership, [[@Willink2015]](title).
In leadership the individual has the ability to motivate, influence and to empower the members of the group in order to achieve the success of the organization. 

# Trait Theory

The Trait theory and 'Great Man theory' believes that leaders inherit traits and particular qualities in order to become a leader. To be and become a leader you need to possess certain characteristics. Those can be for example by military leaders, politicians or famous company leaders for example Steve Jobs.

# Real time example

In my humble opinion it is difficult to see true leadership as I have experienced a narcissistic manager who was just driven by results and did not care about team members. This is an example of how managers adhere a set of pre-defined organisations goals and targets.
On the other hand, the company offers fellowships in order to learn how other teams are lead and managed. Through the cross training I was send abroad on a business trip to do a training for new batch who will be leading a new department in APJ.
In the second experience I had a manager who lead through motivation, inspiration and with a charismatic approach.
Through this I experienced 2 types of leaderships: Leadership as a result for first manager. The second manager possed all 4 typologies of leadership according to Grint [[@Grint-2000fk]]()
