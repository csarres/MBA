# Conclusions

Even though there are challenges with online learning, there are many opportunities, and I am positive that with the appropriate strategies, the learning experience can be very productive.
I will gain new knowledge which I can use for my current job and bring in new ideas for a smart team. The team will acknowledge this new knowledge and we will use it to our advantage and the advantage for the company.
