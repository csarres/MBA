Charisma displays both social and leadership skills. Charismatic leaders have the warmth and competence that engages and persuades others. [[@VanEdwards]]()

These  people  represents  the company  as a whole, their  followers  connect with them and considered them as an absolute role model.

As the Greek word Charisma means “gift of grace”, a Charismatic CEO has the gift of the Four “I” theory as follows: ‘Idealised influence’, ‘Individualised consideration’, ‘Inspirational motivation’,  and  ‘Intellectual stimulation. [[@Forster-2005fv]]()  According to Kolb:  “Charismatic leadership really is a function of the whole situation.  It is leader identity, leader behavior, follower identity, sociocultural context and organizational setting all working together concurrently.” [[@Jackson-2008rq]]()

For example, the founders of SAP, just to mention two persons out of 5, Dietmar Hopp and Hasso Plattner. They had a big influence on people as they had the vision to establish a standard enterprise software which integrated all business processes and data processing in real time. They succeeded as people trusted them and followed them. Companies started to introduce SAP software. [[@Leiter2022]]()
The founders have proven directive and supportive dimensions as they have appropriately reacted to new situations, as for example the introduction of new software.

And this goes to say Charismatic leaders increase the level of social identification in followers by helping them to see how their efforts at work are related to an overall vision. If the vision is ideologically appealing to the followers, then it can help to make work seem more meaningful [[@Yukl2010]]()

We should also have a quick look on path-goal theory. To have a gift is not everything you also need to generate motivation. It reflects the characteristics of the employee and their task characteristics. There are 4 key points in the Path-Goal theory and if they are matched according to the needs of the follower they can be successful [[@House1971]]()

Having a charismatic CEO is vital in an organisation.
