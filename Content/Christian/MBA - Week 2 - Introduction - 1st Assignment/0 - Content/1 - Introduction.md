# Introduction


As my MBA online course first assignment is to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of studying online, to  reflect also of what are the strategies available for me to use in order to succeed in this new form of studying.  The sense of the topic is itself challenging! 

Year 2020, no one knows how in that year has stopped and changed the world in all aspects including education. It introduced everyone to the world of internet and its technology, creating and making how students nowadays are able to study online.  

Online study was never a real option until that year 2020 as it changed dramatically with the Corona Virus outbreak, causing closures of public and private offices, buildings, schools and universities.

# Advantages and Disadvantages

Because of lockdown, everything had to be done online. Countries like Singapore and the United Kingdom had little problems as they have up-to-date technology and online services available whereas Germany had some slight issues due to lack of IT services and Infrastructure ([[@Schulze-2016]](c), [[@Douglas-2019]](p)). Mentioning these already shows some the advantages and disadvantages of online studies:

## Advantages

1.  Online studies allow to combine work and private obligations with study activites ([[@ASUUniversity-2022]](c)).
2. Digital access to the library is becoming much more commonplace and improves the working environment of the researcher
3. Online forums allow for an interactive discussion at the pace and availability of each researcher, as there is no need to be online at the same time

## Disadvantages

1. Connectivity issues, particularly in less connected areas of the world, can lead issues doing resarch and turning in homework at the right time
2. Missing knowledge of how to backup data can lead to missing deadlines due to unexpected data loss
3. Missing personal contact can undermine the effectiveness of study groups as well as discussions with advisors
4. The use of digital tools may be limited due to country-specific regulations for data protection ([[@Caschy-2022]](c), [[@Pakalski-2022]](c)) 


# Strategies



Moving on, with all of what was mentioned above I’ve come up with my plans and strategies on how I will proceed and be able to succeed in this MBA course:

## Time Management

First of all, time management---blocking the time on my calendar.  Since I have the support of my company, I am allowed to block the time during my working hours as it will allow me to do assignments and book reading along with my daily work tasks.

With this flexibility, it then motivates me to do my online studies plus I am able to fulfil my work without any worries.  

## Library

Another thing to mention is the availability of the sources that I will be needing throughout this course is the University’s online library.

## Student Support

Also, if I am in doubt the university offers the student support centre (7) which for me is a huge help since I am in Germany and is most of the line relying with online study.

## Interactive Sessions

With this course, it gives me a unique opportunity as it promotes a life-long learning, that I can interact live with my professors and tutors using applications such as Zoom.

## Communication

Since this is an online course, the ability to do interpersonal communication is limited and it can be lonely doing it alone and will build up anxiety that will create stress and pressure I am lucky as I am doing this in the comfort of my home and having my family around as my support system.
