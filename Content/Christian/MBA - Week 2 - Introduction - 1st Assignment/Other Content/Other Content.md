As Covid-19 spreads fast during 2020 and became pandemic there were a lot of institutions globally struggled on how to stay afloat as well as how to create a solid plan to weather the situations like in the field of education and learning.  Let’s face it, no one knows that it will be that bad and a lot of us thought that it will be gone in a few months but sadly it is still pandemic at this moment as I write this paper.

As the issue progress, schools and universities have dilemma on how to continue with the learning process, e.g.  how teachers will conduct their classes in order for the students not to miss their lessons for the year. *ref* Some schools and universities had issues *ref* on what is the suitable application to use and invest on for home learning as health and safety is at the best interest of the institution.

Germany as an example, since each state has its own approach and responsibilities in terms of how their education system will be during pandemic had encountered some issues, to mention a few is the use of Microsoft Teams. At the beginning of the pandemic Microsoft teams was being use but eventually was stopped because of Data privacy [[@Caschy-2022]],()[[@Pakalski-2022]]() (4,5) and until now has left with no concrete solution of what tool to use in order for schools and universities to have a better learning strategy.

If we look back on how it was pre-pandemic, as every student, faculty members, university professors and the like are used to having personal encounters, had meetings and discussions face to face on any given time was suddenly forced to do online classes when the pandemic started.  Since everyone was asked to stay at home and no need was allowed to leave the house for school, there has been pros and cons. (On the side of advantages) For the Pros, students, professors, teachers have the option to choose their learning venue in their house.  Another is doing multi-tasking where people are able to look after their kids or cook lunch while having e-learning.  Some of the disadvantages are, that not everyone has: Fast internet, nor can they have it because of rural areas, or can’t afford electronic gadgets for example: computer or tablet just to name a few. Basically, these are just common situations that everyone had experience but in spite of it I will say it is all up to the person on how he/she will manage the situation and to have self-discipline [[@ASUUniversity-2022]]().

Most of us are aware of the term “Global Village”, that we can do the work from wherever and whenever. The term “Global Village” was first emphasised in the book “The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man”, Marshall McLuhan originally published 1962, republished 2011 page 

The term "Global Village" was first emphasized by [[@McLuhan-1962]](t) where he predicte that electronic devices would connect people around the world and will transform the world into a village. (25)[[@McLuhan-1962]](p).

Another point worth mentioning is the saving of money and the carbon footprint.  I do not have to travel by car or train to the university. Costs for fuel and parking and taking public transport are cut to a minimum.

Moving on, with all of what was mentioned above I’ve come up with my plans and strategies on how I will proceed and be able to succeed in this MBA course.

First of all, time management - blocking the time on my calendar.  Since I have the support of my company, I am allowed to block the time during my working hours as it will allow me to do assignments and book reading along with my daily work tasks.

With this flexibility, it then motivates me to do my online studies plus I am able to fulfil my work without any worries.  

Another thing to mention is the availability of the sources that I will be needing throughout this course is the University’s online library.

Also, if I am in doubt the university offers the student support centre (7) which for me is a huge help since I am in Germany and is most of the line relying with online study.

With this course, it gives me a unique opportunity as it promotes a life-long learning, that I can interact live with my professors and tutors using applications such as Zoom.

Since this is an online course, the ability to do interpersonal communication is limited and it can be lonely doing it alone and will build up anxiety that will create stress and pressure I am lucky as I am doing this in the comfort of my home and having my family around as my support system.
