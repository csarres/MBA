## History of Sogo Shosha

The Beginning of Sogo Shosha was the end of the Tokugawa government, also called Edo Period. This government was a military dynasty and was ruled by the dictators of Edo, now Tokyo. This is why it is called Tokugawa.

It began in 1600, when Tokugawa Ieyasu defeated several rivals for power. In 1603 he was the emperor of Japan. This period ended in 1867 after more than 250 years of peace, prosperity and progress in Japan. Japan did not trade contact with other countries due to of its constricted rigid class of hierarchy. The period ended with the restoration of the Meiji emperor.

The Meiji emperor of Japan wanted a national revolution in Japan. Meiji derives from Prince Mutsuhito, the emperor of Japan.

Japan had to open its borders after the Western trade during the 1850s and 60’s.

High ranking personalities in Japan decided that Japan would need a strong government and access to technology from the west. Japan had a lack of technology compared to the west and did not want to be over ruled by western countries. At this time Prince Mutsuhito made the “enlightened rule”. This rule was a new chapter in the government of Japan. The first time the government was more a symbol of national unity and gave the economical power to ministers or secretaries of state who controlled companies. At least the companies were controlled by the state. During the Meiji period, Japan came to industrial power and was competitive to western countries ([[@Simley-2006aa]]).


But these ministers had a lack of experience in management. To solve this problem, the government had to go to family business owners and wealthy families to gain experience in how to manage companies. The most important companies during that time were: Shimada, Ono, Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, Mitsui.

These companies were import and export companies and not manufactures. These trading companies were more focused on advertisement and marketing of lots of products instead of manufacturing them.

The companies which joined Sogo Shosha grew tremendously. Mitsui established as a simple trading company turned into a major trading institution. The reason for this was, that the managementof Mitsui had connections to the Meiji leadership and sponsored them. Therefore Mitsui had the privilege to enter the trading, mining and banking sector and was attaining a semi official status. These honours the government did not grant not for free. Vice versa Mitsui had the assignment to advance Japan’s industrialization.

Mitsubishi grew very fast to a big company for ships while Mitsui became the leader for exports. Sumimoto was the leader in Japan for mining. Even today Sumitomo is a leader for mining in Asia. Ono and Shimada were united to Yasuda. It is Japan largest bank.

All these companies worked together and grew in size and scale. This cooperation enabled Japan to establish relationships with local and international politicians. The influence was so tremendous that Japan had war with Korea, Manchuria, Taiwan and China. A new colonial interest awoke, the new countries provided Japan with everything which was needed in Japan. So Japan was able to preserve its own natural resources, especially coal, lumber, agricultural and animal products. Most of these agricultural areas became highly developed industrial centers. In the world a picture of Sogo Shosha was created, a money clique or zaibatsu.

Zaibatsu translated means that everything is based on one enterprise, sogo shosha, and everything else is surrounded by the company connected firms, like insurance, banking, shipping, mining, food production.

Zaibatsu is also based on the Japanese tradition. Each person is important and with manpower and money, zaibatsu had enormous political influence and technological know how.

With these components, zaibatsu reached its peak in power until 1920.

In 1930 zaibatsu lost their independence from political force. It happened because nationalist military forces gained the power of the government and political departments. Zaibatsu was a target of these disturbances. As a result the chairman of Mitsu was assassinated by military fanatics.

In 1937 the army launched a war against China. The army leaders saw that their success was based on the enterprises. Zaibatsu became a synonym for a military-industrial complex.

After World War II the American military occupation authority, also known as SCAP, had the mission to change the ecomic, political and social reforms. Because it was evident that the

resurrection of zaibatsu would create a new war. In consequence, SCAP declined the number of companies from 200 to 139 and ended the anti monopoly in Japan. Finally Sogo Shosha activities ceased during the occupation by the Americans. In 1950 after the occupation the monopoly had come to an end. In 1952 Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo re-established their groups. But from this time on, the relationships were just commercial. This was the end of the zaibatsu and the beginning of keiretsu, with banks and zaikai for the financial circles and expanded into new lines of businesses.

But very fast the new government recognized that the old zaibatsu system could be very good to rebuilding the Japanese economy. After the reforming the offices for selling the goods abroad, capital was generated for the economics in Japan. Especially the rebuilding of steel making, building ships, oil refining, automobile manufacturing, the generation of power and the construction of roads.

The new Sogo Shosha conglomerates was led by the old companies but with the help of smaller companies made it possible to expand the exports for a period of 60 years.

Sogo Shosha worked in conjunction with the governments department, Ministry of International Trade und Industry (MITI). The strategy was to develop industries in Japan. Before that, these companies brought products to Japan like textiles, simple electronics from markets in the US, Europe and Asia.  This was the first step to accumulate money for heavy industry. After the introduction of the heavy industry, Sogo Shosha saw that the new economy would be the electronic market. Companies like Sony, Ricoh, Canon, Matsushita, Hitachi were established but were not integrated in Sogo Shosha.

Similarities from Sogo Shosha can be found also in other countries. One of the closest countries of that is South Korea. The following companies are in this group: LG Group, Ssangyong, Samsung, Hyundai and others. Compared to Japan, South Korea is now at a point like Japan 20 years ago. Also China established a trading company of sogo shosha style in the mid 1990’s. China could not do it with its own power. China had received assistance from Japan. The efforts rose and ended up in a joint venture with Lansheng and Daewoo Co.

The United States tried to initiate the Sogo Shosha in the early 1980s which ended in the Trading Company Act of 1982.

It should encourage even small companies to join this trade union. The small companies who could not afford it had backup by government banks. But the problem was that the export trading company was mostly never developed.
