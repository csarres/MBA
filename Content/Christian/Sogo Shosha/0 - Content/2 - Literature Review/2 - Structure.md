## Structure of Sogo Shosha

In such large companies there is a head who speaks for all companies. But all companies place their own spokesman of the company.

Compared to Europe and the United States there is a big difference. There is no single entity in the group. But together the companies have a majority of shares, in effect, comprising a controlling interest. ^us

But also the complex system of shares. Each company owns shares from the other company. A result of that is that in a sogo shosha there can not be subsidiaries.

Compared to Europe, it means that Mercedes Benz holds shares from Bosch, but Bosch may not hold simultaneously shares from Mercedes Benz. The same is in the United States.

In Japan, is this a common feature of sogo shosha. It is allowed for several reasons. First of all is the long existence of sogo shosha of more than 100 years. It has become a traditional institution.

The Japanese government also recoginzes the high efficency and synergy effect, for example, each company has a stake in the other financial areas of the company and the company concentrates its own resources to realize that.

They are not anti competitive. There are more conglomerates in Japan with the same system of sogo shosha. Each of them is highly diversified and compete in specific industrial sectors against the other sogo sosha and independent companies. It was established because if expansion in one business field would lead to a concentration it would bring frustration to the competitors and the government would be forced to reduce its presence in that market. It can be seen from the high moral standart in Japan. While in Japan the welfare of the competitors is important but not in the United Staes and Europe. It is based on the Japanese tradition.
