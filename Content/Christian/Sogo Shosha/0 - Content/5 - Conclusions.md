# Conclusions
I do not think that trading companies like sogo sosha in japan will become common in the European Union or the United States. The reasons for that is that here in the European Union we are much to focused on the United States vice versa. See (vr)[[2 - Structure#^us]].

Tradition and moral values in Japan are higher than here in Europe. To stay in a competition but just in a competition in which everybody is a winner. In the western trade system as well as in the financial system we have winners and losers. In the Sogo Shosha system everybody should be a winner. We do not understand this special far east mentality yet.

I think it will take a long time for us to experience the advantages of such a system.
