### * Research Focus

This research concerns the inner workings of Intrapreneurship Programs. There is ample research about the antecedents that lead up to companies investing in such programs, and likewise extensive research about what happens after the end of such programs with the ideas that went through to the end, as well as those that were selected out.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic, longitudinal, quantitative and qualitative research about the inner workings of such programs. In other words, previous studies have not been able to address what happens during the runtime of an Intrapreneurship, or Organizational Entrepreneurship, program. Chapter [[0 - Literature Review|Literature Review]] reviews the literature establishing this gap in prior research.

Against this background, this research aims to study the inner workings of intrapreneurship programs asking the following research question:

from two perspectives: The program management and the participants in the program.

Chapters [[1 - Research Problem#Problem Statement|Problem Statement]], [[0 - Aims|Aims]] and [[0 - Objectives|Objectives]] describe the problem statement, as well as the aims and objectives more in detail.
