### * Research Approach

We undertake a longitudinal study over three years following several intrapreneurship cohorts, based both on quantitative data analysis using machine learning of structured and unstructured data, as well as qualitative data analysis leveraging expert interviews and Delphi panels of members of the winning teams, as well as the program members, at the end of the program.

We are going to interact with the intrapreneurship program at three points:

1. During the stage of identification of team members, we are going to develop machine learning based classifiers that allow to identify the most promising team members.
2. During the runtime of each cohort, we are going to use machine learning based natural language processing to identify, from the content generated by the teams, aspects that indicate a winning idea.
3. At the end of each cohort, we are going to do expert interviews based on the Delphi method with both the program management as well as the members of the winning teams to validate the classifiers used at the beginning.

Chapter [[0 - Methodology|Methodology]] describes the methodological approach more in detail, and chapter [[0 - Expected Results|Expected Results]] discusses the expected results, as far as they can be predicted against the background of a pilot study that we executed.
