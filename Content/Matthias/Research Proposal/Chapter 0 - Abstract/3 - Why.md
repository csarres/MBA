### * Research Contribution

Because of the lack of research into the inner workings of Organizational Entrepreneurship programs, companies are investing heavily in these programs without being well informed about what works and what does not: They may focus on the ideas rather than on the teams, and when focusing on the teams, they may not be performing optimally at finding the right team members. As a result, not only could the programs perform sub-optimally, but in addition, there is a great chance of losing valuable business ideas, while giving too much time to ideas that eventually would be selected out. Chapters [[1 - Audiences|Audiences]] and [vr#Significance] deal with these topics more in detail, discussing the audience of the research, and its significance.
