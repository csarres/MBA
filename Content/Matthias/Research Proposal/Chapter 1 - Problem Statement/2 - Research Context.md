### Research Context

The author has a strong personal motivation for this research: In 2015, the company that he is working for, SAP, one of the largest software firms globally, started an "Intrapreneurship Program" designed to inspire the development of promising new products and services of the company. The author's team won the first round of the program, which means, their idea received the green light to be funded and incubated, and then was unsuccessful in actually finding a sponsor that would host the incubation of the idea. Building on this failure, the author intends to research the what would be beneficial to a program of Corporate Entrepreneurship that strives for a successful transition of an innovative idea into an incubated corporate venture.

The research will be carried out within the organizational boundaries of SAP, where the author has been given access to the data that emerges from the ongoing Intrapreneurship program.
