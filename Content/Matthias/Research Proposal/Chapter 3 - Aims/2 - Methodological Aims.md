### Methodological Aims

On the methodological level, until very recently, an evaluation of potential team members of startup initiatives was mostly of qualitative nature and only flanked by quantitative evaluation of certain structured data such as revenue projections, membership networks, etc.: Most of the data is yet available as unstructured text, and text mining using machine learning approaches has developed only in recent years. The substantial investments made in intrapreneurship programs need to be justified quantitatively; hence, it appears a very valuable undertaking from a business practitioner's view to measure to which degree Corporate Entrepreneurship programs manage to improve the identification and support of the teams and their work, and machine learning techniques for natural language processing and text classification could have the potential to provide for such measures.
