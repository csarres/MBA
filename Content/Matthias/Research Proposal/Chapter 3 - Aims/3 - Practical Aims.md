### Practical Aims

On the practical level, we observe that a significant challenge that most startups go through is iterative, shared decision making. "Running into the wrong direction," leading to so-called pivots, is not only frustrating, it is also time-consuming and can cause the termination of an otherwise very promising idea, incurring potentially high opportunity costs. One contribution that this study intends to make by its study design is to provide for a substantial simplification of these decision making processes, using and simplifying a method called Delphi.
