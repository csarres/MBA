### Methodological Significance

Particularly with a high number of submissions, the ranking of these teams is a tedious and error-prone process. At the same time, as established in the previous section, the more efficient the program is at selecting teams and improving the quality of their ideas, the higher the cost impact of committing errors. Therefore, using automated methods such as machine learning not only have the potential to reduce workload of the program members, but more importantly could increase the reproducibility of the decision making process. While machine learning, at its core, can only establish correlation, and never causality, the process has the potential to run in an automated way, thereby at least raising red flags when a choice made by the system is sufficiently distant from the choice made by the program members.

As the pilot study carried out as part of this research has shown, a comparatively simple, machine learning based text clustering method such as k-Nearest Neighbors can be efficiently used to separate winners from losers based purely on an analysis of unstructured text, such as idea submissions or people profiles.
