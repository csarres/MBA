##### The Venture Team

Through a questionnaire study and personal interviews, [[@Hill-1972aa]](t) evaluate the construct of a "venture team" as an alternative to conventional product development and marketing, as it is characterized by a single mission, relationships that are unstructured and hence do not tend to get into the way of critical analysis, an organizational and often even geographic isolation from the parent company, and ultimately an entitlement generated by the team's venture program often being assigned to a high level within the organization. (46--47)[[@Hill-1972aa]](t) identify seven structural characteristics of a successful implementation of corporate entrepreneurship:


1. *Organizational separation:* Both a physical as well as a separation in reporting lines was found to be most effective.
2. *Multidisciplinarity:* Drawing venture team members not only from technical areas was seen as essential for the creativity of venture teams.
3. *Diffusion of Authority:* A flat hierarchy, independent from job descriptions and organisational level that team members otherwise had, was seen to foster an environment open to criticism of ideas.
4. *Environment of Entrepreneurship:* An arrangement of venture team members to share profits of the venture was seen as beneficial; and when team members had been asked to contribute of their own money, this "produced a high degree of involvement on the part of team members in the analysis and solution of problems." ((47)[[@Hill-1972aa]])
5. *Top Management Linkage:* The authors found the head of the venture program to typically report to a division head or C-level officer, thus establishing high-level support as well as eliminating communication problems through the hierarchy.__As indicated on page [pr# intro], while this question has been brought up throughout the years, it took until last year for [[@Fisher-2017aa]](t) turn the research focus to it.__
6. *Broad Mission:* Rather than focusing on products or processes, the teams' missions tended to typically be market- and growth oriented.
7. *Flexible Life Span:* Strict deadlines and other time pressures were seen beneficial to be removed.
