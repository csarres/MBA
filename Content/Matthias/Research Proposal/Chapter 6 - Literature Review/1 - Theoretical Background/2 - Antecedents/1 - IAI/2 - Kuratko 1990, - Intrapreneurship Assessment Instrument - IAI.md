##### The Intrapreneurial Assessment Instrument (IAI)

In line with [[@Jennings-1990aa]](a), and building on their critique of  [[@Pinchot-1985aa]](a), [[@Kuratko-1990aa]](t) concentrate their research on the "managerial" part of Corporate Entrepreneurship and find that the middle managers are the key inside those organizations. As a result, they focus on perceptions, actions, outcomes and ethical consequences [l# ethical consequences] of corporate entrepreneurship. ^ethicalconsequences

The authors find that in order to understand the most effective internal environment for corporate entrepreneurial activity, an examination of antecedents to individual entrepreneurial behavior is critical. In their article [[@Kuratko-1990aa]](title), they construct an "Intrapreneurial Assessment Instrument (IAI)." ((49)[[@Kuratko-1990aa]](y)). Using Pinchot's popular word, they try to isolate those antecedents, in other words, the most important environmental factors, of which they are able to validate the first three:

1. Management Support for Intrapreneurship
2. Organizational Structure
3. Reward and Resource Availability
4. Risk-Taking
5. Time Availability ^iai

Based on this research, [[@Kuratko-1990aa]](t) describe the development of the first instrument used to measure the environment within a corporation seeking to initiate entrepreneurial activity. This instrument, known as Intrapreneurial Assessment Instrument (IAI), containing the first three of the above-mentioned environmental factors, was then used to gather data within a large, US-based, Fortune 500 firm. Since that was a U.S. based study, the authors suggested to expand the research to larger entities, other industries, and internationally.
