[[@Covin-2015aa]](t) build and test a model of venture performance drawing on data from 145 internal corporate ventures (ICVs). They find that the evolution of value proposition is related to venture performance in a curvilinear manner. Specifically, the article establishes two instruments, one for managers of the ventures, and one for the parental, senior managers over them, and finds that ICVs whose propositions exhibit moderate evolution perform better than those that show either no or extensive evolution; in addition, the value proposition evolution-performance relationship is moderated by the degree to which the parent corporation is familiar with the venture's target market.
