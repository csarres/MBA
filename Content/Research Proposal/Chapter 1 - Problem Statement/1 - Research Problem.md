## Problem Statement

### Research Problem

As detailed in chapter [[0 - Literature Review|Literature Review]], Intrapreneurship, also known as Corporate Entrepreneurship (CE) or Organisational Entrepreneurship (OE), has been studied since 1972. The topic concerns the activities of large organisations designed to harness the innovative power of startups embedded in the broader organisational context. The motivations of organisations to engage in such activities---the so-called antecedents of organisational entrepreneurship---have been the focus of numerous studies, and also the outcome of such programs.

An Organizational Entrepreneurship program typically starts with offering to the body of the organisation a platform to suggest innovative ideas for future product or service design. It then runs a selection process to select teams that, depending on the applied selection criteria, are understood to have the largest potential value for the organisation and that have the strongest indication of being able to create the traction needed to drive an idea to incubation.

The selected teams then usually undergo an acceleration process, within which a team is tasked with developing the idea to a stage where it can be either incubated, i.e., developed as part of the organization's line of products or services, or excubated, in other words spun off, as a separate business unit.


Prior research has taken different attempts to assess the readiness of organizations to engage in Corporate Entrepreneurship; in other words, the field has in extenso constructed understanding about when and how to engage in programs that would promote innovative ideas generated from within organizations, i.e., antecedents of such programs. The more recent literature extends the research to the outcomes of these programs, including aspects of dealing with failure, and legitimacy.

What appears to be less covered in the literature is the assessment of the efficiency throughout such programs as they promote innovations inside an organization. In other words, there is a lack of research that focuses on this specific acceleration process. While there is ample research about that process in the startup community, when it comes to startups that are embedded in a larger organisational context, such research is scarce. One can only speculate why: Typically, organisations would be reluctant to offer insight into the emergence of their most innovative ideas, and even much less so in the context of a longitudinal study.


This gap in research focus has also been confirmed in a conversation the author had in 2016 with one of the leading researchers in the area, Donald Kuratko, and it entails an opportunity for contribution to practice, as Corporate Entrepreneurship programs need to justify the investment made as a function of their effectiveness to improve the quality of the teams they promote: When organisations engage in Organizational Entrepreneurship programs, they are not well informed by prior research as to how to implement the program; they not only invest substantial amounts of money into a program, they also risk turning down their most innovative workforce if they do not run the program well.

In addition, compared to external startups that only compete with the market, startups that are embedded in an organisational context also compete with the larger organisation itself: For example, they face challenges such as organisational resistance when ideas submitted to the program have the potential to compete with, and be seen as a threat by, other teams in the larger organizational context.
