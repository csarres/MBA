### Theoretical Significance



A counter-argument to the relevance of this research, that an organization could bring forward, might be that their program is already very efficient at selecting teams and ideas and at improving their quality. As we show in this section, the opposite is the case.

In particular companies making this claim should be very interested in this research. To establish the significance of this research from a theoretical perspective, we are going to compare two scenarios (see Exhibit [r#exhibit:Impact-of-Errors]):

- *High Program Efficiency:* In this scenario, the program is very efficient at selecting the teams that run through the program and in improving the quality of their ideas. Exhibit [r#exhibit:Impact-of-Errors] shows this scenario as a set of dotted lines: Since the program is efficient at improving the quality of the ideas, the opportunity costs of missing out on one of these ideas are comparatively high; and since the program is efficient at selecting teams, the marginal cost of one idea declines strongly. ```\bigskip```
- *Low Program Efficiency:* Represented as continuous lines, in this scenario, the program is less efficient at selecting teams and at improving the quality of ideas. As a result, the marginal costs of the program decline less sharply, and likewise, because any given idea will have received less of a benefit by the program, the opportunity costs of missing out one of those ideas are lower.

This view shows that the significance of this research is higher, the higher the efficiency of the program: The impact of making an error and selecting out a team that would have had a great contribution to the organization is much higher in the high efficiency case. Therefore, particularly if an organization is already good at selecting teams and improving their ideas, this research is even so more important.
