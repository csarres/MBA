### Practical Significance

One aspect of the qualitative study will be to elicit the beneficial aspects of the program recurring to panels of experts in the frame of a longitudinal Delphi study. A Delphi study basically asks experts to rank characteristics as per their perceived ability to contribute to a given goal. It then collects these rankings, and calculates "Kendall's $W$," a factor that can be understood as a level of agreement of these experts. Next, it presents the rankings to the same panel of experts for them to reconsider their choice, and repeats the process. As a result, very typically the rankings, and hence the agreement, tend to converge; in that sense, the Delphi method can be utilized as a tool to mediate a decision-finding process.

The challenge with this approach is that the underlying mathematics---see equation [er#eqn:w1] on page [pr#eqn:w1]---does not easily lend itself to the business user: Because of the complexity involved, Delphi studies are typically not executed to find agreement as part of project settings. As this study will show, by rewriting the mathematics behind Delphi, the method can be made easily accessible to the business user, and thus improve the decision making processes.
