This chapter gives an exhaustive review of the literature related to the research proposal: First, we describe the literature about the subject matter, i.e., Corporate Entrepreneurship (section [vr#Theoretical Background]); this allows us to establish the gaps in the literature that this research is attempting to close. Then, we give an overview of the state of the art of methodological approaches (section [vr#Methodological Background]).
