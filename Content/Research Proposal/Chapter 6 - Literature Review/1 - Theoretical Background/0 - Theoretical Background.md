### Theoretical Background

From a historical perspective, this literature review contextualizes the key articles about Organizational Entrepreneurship since 1972, showing the main concepts they address and the shifts in perspectives and theory that they induce (see Exhibit [r#exhibit:Historical-Literature-Review]): After first sporadic reviews of the topic ([[@Peterson-1971aa]](c); [[@Hill-1972aa]](c)) in the 1970s, the term "Intrapreneurship" is coined by [[@Pinchot-1985aa]](t), and while [[@Burgelman-1984aa]](t) theorizes that innovative initiatives inside organizations would be driven mainly from lower ranks of the organization (a claim that [[@Hornsby-2009aa]](t) are later able to empirically disprove) the first major contradiction against Pinchot's model comes from [[@Montago-1986aa]](t) who caution that Pinchot's model would ultimately motivate entrepreneurs to leave the organization, thereby creating a brain-drain; in other words, that rather than about structural prescripts, Corporate Entrepreneurship is about the most innovative people that an organization needs to retain. In the 1990s, [[@Kuratko-1990aa]](t) establish their "Intrapreneurship Assessment Instrument (IAI)" quantifying three antecedents that would favor entrepreneurial engagement inside organizations.

In 2002, [[@Hornsby-2002aa]](t) are able to extend the instrument into their "Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument (CEAI)," establishing as five antecedents to entrepreneurial activity inside organizations: Management Support, Organizational Structure, Rewards and Resources, Risk Taking and Tolerance for Failure, as well as Time Availability. This literature, in other words, focuses mostly on what may lead to Organizational Entrepreneurship, hence its antecedents.

The literature on what happens within those programs is much more scarce: In the 2000's, [[@Kuratko-2005aa]](t) establish the middle managers as the "lynchpins" of Corporate Entrepreneurship, and while they research what these middle managers actually *do* to further entrepreneurial behavior of organizations, [[@Kuratko-2004aa]](t) take an ethical perspective and investigate what these same people should *not do*. In the early 2010s, the control question is contextualized from an organizational management angle in a highly acclaimed interdisciplinary paper by [[@Goodale-2011aa]](t). Notice that with the exception of [[@Covin-2015aa]](t), measuring value, and [[@Covin-2016aa]](t), focusing on learning, these articles look again at the environment within which corporate ventures would develop, rather than at the ventures themselves: In particular, [[@Kuratko-2009ac]](t) and [[@Ireland-2009aa]](t) study Corporate Entrepreneurship activities a perspective of corporate strategy.

In recent years, [[@Kuratko-2013ab]](t) as well as 
[[@Audretsch-2015aa]](t) break down the different learnings and concepts about Corporate Entrepreneurship. [[@Fisher-2017aa]](t) ask by whom a corporate venture team is actually legitimized as it searches for support and funding; and, in case of failure, 
[[@Shepherd-2009aa]](t) investigate how corporate ventures can deal with the grief process in a way that these teams, who have most likely shown to be among the most valuable, value-creating assets of the corporation, can re-enter the innovation process with new ideas rather than turning away.
