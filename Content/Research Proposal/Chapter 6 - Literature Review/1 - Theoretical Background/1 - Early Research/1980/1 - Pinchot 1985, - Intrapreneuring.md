##### The Appearance of the Term ``Intrapreneurship''

[[@Pinchot-1985aa]](a) coins the term "intrapreneur" as a shorthand for "corporate intrapreneur" ((9)[[@Pinchot-1985aa]]) and focuses mostly on creating structural prescripts to convert large organizations, that he compares with planned economies, into networks of "intra service intraprises" (see also [[@Pinchot-2001aa]](c)), having "internal profit centers" where "service intrapreneurs" serve "internal customers" based on a "joint ownership of intraprises," "intraproperty rights," an "intracapital bank" system, etc. In other words, Pinchot, without explicitly saying so, applies concepts of transaction cost economics ([[@Coase-1937fk]]) to the boundaries of smaller service units that he conceives of in the framework of a larger organization.
