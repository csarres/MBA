##### How to Retain People

[[@Montago-1986aa]](t) observe two fundamental problems with [[@Pinchot-1985aa]](a)'s approach: the retention of corporate entrepreneurs, as well as the need to conceptualize the problem as mainly people driven, and to deal with it on a level of corporate strategy. In contrast to Pinchot, working with teams of each 25 middle managers across internal departmental boundaries of large organizations, the authors realize that the analysis of Corporate Entrepreneurship should begin with people, and not be departmentalized. In particular, the authors see the two issues with Pinchot's approach:

1. *Brain Drain vs. Retention of Intrapreneurs:* Pinchot appears to suggest that a true corporate entrepreneur would eventually chose to leave the company to pursue the venture he started inside, leaving only "deadwood" ((47)[[@Pinchot-1985aa]]) behind.
2. *Tame vs.\ Wicked Problem:* Pinchot approaches the situation as a tame problem ([[@Grint-2005cr]]) and hence suggests a number of out-of-the book strategies. Kuratko very early on understands that the problem is people driven that we would conceptualize and deal with it in today's terms of a wicked problem.

"In the 1980â€™s, researchers conceptualized CE as embodying entrepreneurial behavior requiring organizational sanctions and resource commitments for the purpose of developing different types of value-creating innovations \dots\ CE was defined simply as a process of organizational renewal" ((247)[[@Audretsch-2015aa]]) calling for "a significant change in the management outlook and culture." ((23)[[@Sathe-1989aa]])
