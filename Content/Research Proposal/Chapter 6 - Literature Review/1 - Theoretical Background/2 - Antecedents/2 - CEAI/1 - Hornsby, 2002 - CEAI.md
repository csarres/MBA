##### The Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument (CEAI)

In the Journal of Business Venturing of 2002, (254)[[@Hornsby-2002aa]](t) expand the earlier idea of an Interpreneurship Assessment Instrument, or IAI ([[@Kuratko-1990aa]]), and retitle it "Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument (CEAI)," to get away from the Pinchot's buzzword, in favor of using the more strategic term. It is a diagnostic tool (based on perceptions) for evaluating _how supportive the corporate environment is_ towards corporate venturing initiatives. With the data that the authors collected for this article, they are able to validate all five factors that they had originally hypothesized in 1990: This is hence the first publication that validated the full instrument, including the remaining two factors listed in section [vr#iai], and thereby the first publication that validated the full instrument: ^toplevelmanagers

1. Top Management Support
2. Work Discretion/Autonomy
3. Rewards/Reinforcement
4. Resources/Time Availability
5. Organizational Boundaries

The aforementioned emphasis on perceptions (page (pr)[[2 - Kuratko, 1990 - Intrapreneurship Assessment Instrument - IAI#^ethicalconsequences|Ethical Consequences]]) is a relevant one: As the researchers employed the instrument, they would regularly find a different perception of the ranking of the antecedents, depending on whether they were talking to top level managers or middle level managers: A CEO would typically rank the perceived performance of his organization, as expressed by the five factors, very high, whereas when middle managers were asked (typically the authors had 5 to 6 sets of about 25 people) they would see the situation differently. Thereby, the researchers were able to show to the CEOs where they had seen perceived deficiencies:Â 

- While a CEO might have said to have rewards at the top of the list, the middle managers might have seen it to be one of the lowest.
- While a CEO might have perceived that autonomy was given in this company for things to be done, his middle managers might be are reporting it extremely low.

As Kuratko writes, in each study they did, company after company and industry after industry, they saw this discrepancy: They had seen a perceptional problem, and therefore, developing a perceptional instrument was a powerful approach, since perception is reality: It's that person's reality. They had developed a diagnostic tool not only for researchers, but also to allow researchers to help organizations.
