##### Middle Managers

Because of their focus on middle managers, [[@Kuratko-2005aa]](t) investigate the actual behavior of these middle managers in order to understand why they appear to be the _lynchpins_ inside Corporate Entrepreneurship: while "the role of top-level managers revolves around the making of effective strategic decisions: Decisions that are concerned with setting the firm’s direction and reaching its objectives, the role of middle-level managers focuses on effectively communicating information between the firm's two internal managerial stakeholders (top-level managers and operating-level managers)." ((701)[[@Kuratko-2005aa]](y)) The authors devise a theoretical model to elicit the middle managers' behaviors for successful Corporate Entrepreneurship: Until then, while the authors had identified the _antecedents_ of successful Corporate Entrepreneurship, they had not come up with a recommendation on what middle managers should actually _do_. In their article, the authors identify six behaviors that middle managers show to foster entrepreneurial behavior ((705--707)[[@Kuratko-2005aa]](y)): 

  
- _Endorsement:_ They gather innovative ideas that typically are focused on a technical level. It is their role to evaluate and ultimate endorse them.
- _Refinement_: They "convert malleable entrepreneurial opportunities into initiatives that fit the organization."
- _Shepherding_: They guide ideas and make sure they gain momentum in the organizational context. 
- _Identification_: They identify resources needed for an innovation to sustain on its growth path.
- _Acquisition_: They negotiate between top level managers and idea submitters to acquire the resources that are needed, as well as people that are likely to be favorable for the implementation of a given idea.
- _Deployment_: Once acquired, middle managers ensure that resources are adequatly deployed to support the initiative.
