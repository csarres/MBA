  

[[@Kuratko-2009ac]](t) and [[@Ireland-2009aa]](t) conceptualize the components of a Corporate Entrepreneurship strategy. Building on the middle manager model, the authors develop it to a larger scale for organizations in general, at all levels, broken down by *antecedents*, *elements*, and *outcomes* of Corporate Entrepreneurship strategy:

  

The components of their CE strategy model include ([[@Ireland-2009aa]](y)):

  
- The _antecedents_ of CE strategy, i.e., individual entrepreneurial cognitions of the organization's members and external environmental conditions that invite entrepreneurial activity;
- The _elements_ of CE strategy, i.e., top management's entrepreneurial strategic vision for the firm, organizational architectures that encourage entrepreneurial processes and behavior, and the generic forms of entrepreneurial process that are reflected in entrepreneurial behavior, and
- the _outcomes_ of CE strategy, i.e., organizational outcomes resulting from entrepreneurial actions, including the development of competitive capability and strategic positioning
