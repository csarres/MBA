In 2009, Dean Shepherd from the University of Indiana asks whether there is a difference in the way middle managers are acting in the context of Corporate Entrepreneurship, compared to top level managers above them, or first level managers below. The top level managers perceptions and behaviors had already been analyzed, but the first level managers' data had not. As a result, [[@Hornsby-2009aa]](t) revisit the data and ask the question: With regards to the antecedents elicited in the CEAI, are they supported from all organizational levels? In particular, they look at the number of ideas implemented, not just suggested, and find an interesting relationship with the level of the organization that an idea would originate from: If an idea had originated from a senior level, it was likely that the idea was going to be implemented; for middle managers, some ideas were implemented. But for first line managers, _not a single idea was implemented_, hence empirically invalidating prior theory of [[@Burgelman-1983ab]](t).
