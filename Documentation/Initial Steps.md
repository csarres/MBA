# Initial Steps

The first thing you should do is to create your own directory.  Create your own blank Github repository; assuming your Github user name is `john` and your repository is `dissertation`, then do this within the `make.sh`script:

## List the currently defined Repositories

Enter `remotes` like so:

This shows you that there are currently one remote (`origin`) defined. If you have multiple remotes, the one you're going to use for a default  `git push` will always be the `origin` remote.

As there is already one named `origin`, you can delete or at least rename it:

Now you've made space to add your own repository:

## Add your own Repository

You'll add your own one like so:

If you list the remotes again, you can see your repository:

## Push to your own Repository

(I've renamed my repositories before doing the push, so that I could take the screen shot; yours would be similar).
