Essentially, LaTeX is a markup language. It predates HTML by at least 20 years. Hence, it might look a bit clumsy. At the same time, every text that I wrote as a young student of Physics, over 25 years ago, will still come out precisely the same way as when I wrote it. This consistency is one of the many advantages of LaTeX.

But today, the world has moved on and new markup languages have arrived; the most important of them probably Markdown, and the most important editor for them, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

In Markdown, you can write similar things like in the above example with simply something like

```markdown
  # This is a section header
  
  Some text ^some-label
  
  - An item
  - Another item

  See page (Well, Markdown does not have pages...)
```

This is significantly less clutter. At the same time, as you can see from the last line, since Markdown is not a page description language, but rather something to describe a structure, it does not go all the way to provide the necessary information to a page formatter like LaTeX.
